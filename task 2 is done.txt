                        Task : 02
      

             01: Write a query to get data having length of  Rna structures more than 12 with them being added after 2008.
             
           Query:
                         SELECT * FROM rna
                         WHERE   len>12 
                          AND  timestamp>'2008-12-31'
                         LIMIT 500;
  
             02: How many precomputed Rna are present that are still active and got their last release update before 2022.

         Query: 
                        SELECT * FROM rna_rnc_precomputed
                        WHERE is_active=true
                        AND  update_date <'2022-01-01'
                        LIMIT 1000;

             03: How many total precomputed Rna records for SnoRNA and tRNA were recorded in 2011,2016,2014, and 2020.

         Query:
                       SELECT * FROM rnc_rna_precomputed
                       WHERE rna_type in('SnoRNA','tRNA')
                       AND extract ( year from update_date) IN (2011,2014,2016,2020)
                       LIMIT 500;


          04:  Can you give me the names of all databases built for RNA with minimum length other than 100,200,300,400 and 15.
  
          Query:
                        SELECT  display_name  FROM  rnc_database 
                        WHERE min_length not in (100,200,300,400 and 15)
                         LIMIT 500;

            05:  5: Can you get complete 500 records of sequences for active regions and name your column as myregions in which you are getting
                     the region name column vakue.Then tell me what different chromosomes with exon_count we have for regions including center
                     ,east and north using the name you set for your column.
                 
                   
           Query: 
                           SELECT  region_name  as myregions  FROM  rnc_sequence_regions
                         LIMIT 500;
